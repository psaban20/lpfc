  <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
  <h2>Building LaPorte's Soccer Future, One Player at a Time</h2>
  
  <p class="quote">At the heart of the Club are the hardworking and resilient people of LaPorte.</p>
  
  <p>LaPorte Futbol Club was founded in November 2021 when fourteen community members came together with a vision: to reorganize and revitalize youth soccer in LaPorte. We saw kids with untapped potential, families seeking quality athletic opportunities, and a community that deserved better.</p>
  
  <p>In just three years, we've grown from an idea into a thriving organization serving nearly 400 young athletes and their families. We are a 100% volunteer-run 501(c)(3) non-profit, governed by a dedicated board of directors who believe deeply in soccer's power to transform lives.</p>
  
  <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
  <p>We're in the business of personal development—soccer just happens to be our context. Through the game, we teach discipline, teamwork, resilience, and leadership. We help kids learn to take risks, handle success and failure, and push through discomfort.</p>
  
  <div class="stats-box">
    <h3>BY THE NUMBERS (2024)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✓ 387 Young Athletes</li>
      <li>✓ 299 Families Served</li>
      <li>✓ 25% Year-Over-Year Growth</li>
      <li>✓ 3 Hours Physical Activity per Player/Week</li>
      <li>✓ 100% Volunteer-Led</li>
      <li>✓ 0% Turned Away for Inability to Pay</li>
    </ul>

<!-- PAGE 3: OUR IMPACT & GROWTH -->
<div class="page">
  <h1>OUR IMPACT & GROWTH</h1>
  <h2>Proof That LaPorte Wants This</h2>
  
  <h3>Three Years of Explosive Growth</h3>
  <p>When we reorganized in 2021, we started with 293 kids from 219 families. In 2023, we grew to 308 kids from 239 families. But 2024 has been our breakthrough year: we now serve <strong>387 kids from 299 families</strong>, representing 25% growth in players and 20% growth in families.</p>
  
  <p>This isn't just about numbers. It's about momentum. It's about families telling other families: "You should try LaPorte FC." It's about kids coming home excited about practice. It's about the community responding to quality.</p>
  
  <h3>Community Reach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>36,000 Facebook views (20% growth year-over-year)</li>
    <li>1,033 social media followers</li>
    <li>Reach across LaPorte and surrounding communities including Michigan City, Westville, Rolling Prairie, and beyond</li>
    <li>Primary audience: families aged 25-44 (parents of young children)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Health Impact</h3>
  <p>On average, a LaPorte FC player receives 3 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. In an era of childhood obesity and screen addiction, we're giving kids the gift of movement, fresh air, and physical challenge. We're building healthy habits that will last a lifetime.</p>
  
  <p class="quote">"This is a 25-year project. We've proven the model works. Now we're ready to scale."</p>

<!-- PAGE 4: THE ENDOWMENT -->
<div class="page">
  <h1>THE ENDOWMENT</h1>
  <h2>Building a Foundation That Lasts Generations</h2>
  
  <div class="highlight">
    <h3>GOAL</h3>
    <div class="big-number">$2 Million</div>
    <p style="color: white; margin: 0;">by December 31, 2027</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Our Proudest Achievement</h3>
  <p>One of our most significant accomplishments—especially for a young organization—is establishing an endowment. This is rare for a club of our size and age, but it reflects our serious commitment to permanence.</p>
  
  <p>An endowment is more than a bank account. It's a promise to future generations that LaPorte FC will be here for them, just as it's here today. It's a hedge against economic uncertainty, leadership transitions, and the inevitable challenges every organization faces.</p>
  
  <h3>How the Endowment Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Principal invested conservatively (currently in Vanguard funds)</li>
    <li>Draws 0-7% annually for general operations</li>
    <li>Principal preserved and grows over time</li>
    <li>Board fiduciary oversight with annual reporting</li>
    <li>Transparent reporting to donors</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>What Endowment Funds Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Coaching education and development</li>
    <li>Equipment and uniforms for families who need assistance</li>
    <li>Field maintenance and improvements</li>
    <li>Referee training and certification</li>
    <li>Administrative support as we grow</li>
    <li>Scholarship programs</li>
    <li>Emergency reserves</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="quote">"This is a 25-year project. The endowment ensures we'll be here for kids who haven't even been born yet."</p>

<!-- PAGE 5: THE ACADEMY -->
<div class="page">
  <h1>THE ACADEMY</h1>
  <h2>Reversing Pay-to-Play - Quality Soccer, Accessible to All</h2>
  
  <h3>The Problem with American Youth Soccer</h3>
  <p>In the United States, youth soccer operates on a "pay-to-play" model. Families pay hundreds or thousands of dollars per year for their children to participate. Higher levels of competition cost more. Elite training costs even more.</p>
  
  <p>The result? Soccer has become a sport for families who can afford it. Talented kids from working-class families—kids with real potential—are excluded simply because they can't pay. Opportunity and potential go untapped.</p>
  
  <h3>Our Solution: The Academy Model</h3>
  <p>LaPorte FC is committed to implementing the Academy Model used by top soccer clubs worldwide. In this model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Participation invitation-based on ability and commitment, not ability to pay</li>
    <li>Talented players from all economic backgrounds identified and developed</li>
    <li>Coaching, equipment, training, and competition costs subsidized</li>
    <li>Quality of instruction paramount</li>
    <li>Player development drives decisions, not revenue</li>
  </ul>
